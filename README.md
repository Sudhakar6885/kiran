Its a Plant Leaf Disease Detection System based on Machine Learning. 
I have used Tomato Leaves Dataset from kaggle.
This system detects the disease and provide remedies for curing it.
I have also made a website with the help of WordPress.
Here for this project, I have used Google Colab, VS Code, Kaggle, Anaconda Shell Prompt.
